Together we will encounter the Lord, expose the Lake Tahoe area to Jesus Christ, experience Christ-centered community, and expand our vision for the campus and the world.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 Lake Tahoe Summer Project is open to both quarter and semester school students. The projected cost of the project is $3200 which includes breakfast and dinner five days per week.\r\n\r\nThe project will be comprised of approximately 100 students from around the country, as well as 30 staff, predominantly from the Greater Northwest.\r\n\r\nProject housing is located just west of the city of South Lake Tahoe, CA (elevation 6260') within a short walk of the shores of Lake Tahoe. All students are required to have a full-time job during project (30+ hours a week). Due to long-standing relations with South Lake Tahoe businesses, most students are hired within the first week or so of project.
